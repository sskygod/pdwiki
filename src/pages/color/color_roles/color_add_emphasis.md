# colors can add emphasis in your design

**A change in color can draw the attention of users to a focal point in your design.**

- That focal point is often an important action you want users to take, like a sign-up link or a purchase button.

> Think about the homepage of our dog walker app. We'll want to add emphasis to the schedule button. So we'll probably make that button a bright color.

- *One common rule that UX designers use is the [60-30-10 rule](../color_system/rules/rule_60-30-10/rule_60-30-10).*

> In our dog walker app, we might use white as 60 percent of the color in the design, gray as 30 percent, and orange as 10 percent. Accent colors, like orange in our case, can be used to emphasize or highlight information, whereas neutral colors play a supportive role in backgrounds, lines, and text.
