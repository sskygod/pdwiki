# Roles of Color

**Color choices and combinations are used in UX design to add emphasis and communicate branding and can impact accessibility.**

Using color effectively in your designs should help users better navigate the product. In design, colors have several meanings, including: [4]

- [colors communicate emotion](./colors_communicate_emotion): Different colors evoke different emotions in people. While red is associated with passion, blue can evoke calmness. [4]
- [colors can communicate branding](./color_communicate_branding): Companies use a specific color to convey their brand message. [4]
  > For example, Coca-Cola uses red in its logo to represent passion.
- [colors can add emphasis in your design](./color_add_emphasis)
- [colors highlight Functionality]: Colors can also be used to highlight the functional properties of products.
  > For example, an Enter button would have green color whereas a Cancel button would be in red.
- [Cultural significance]: Different cultures assign different meanings to colors.
- [Aesthetics]: Sometimes colors are used simply for aesthetic appeal. [4]
  > For example, UI designers use a specific color because it makes a design beautiful. This is why the latest web design trends give the utmost importance to color.
- [Hierarchy](./colors_create_hierarchy): In design, colors are used to indicate importance or hierarchy. A brighter or bolder color for a call-to-action button makes it stand out on a page.
- [colors can impact the accessibility](./color_impact_accessibility/color_impact_accessibility)
