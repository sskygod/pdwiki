# colors can communicate branding, which is the visual appearance and voice of a company

Colors play an important role in a company's brand guidelines, just like [typography](../../typography/typography). Color helps define a product's visual identity, making it stand out among competitors.

> Think about some of the most globally recognized brands and the colors they feature in their products and logos. Does the yellow of McDonald's arches make you feel cheerful? Does the bold red of Coca-Cola make you feel energetic?

> Some companies even use groups of colors consistently to stand out. For example have you noticed that Google uses four specific colors in all of its branding? Blue, red, yellow, and green.

*When you're working for a company as a new designer, you'll need to be aware of how you use the company's brand colors in your designs. Keep color associations consistent, whether you're designing an app, website, or logo.*
