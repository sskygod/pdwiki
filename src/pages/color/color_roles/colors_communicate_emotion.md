# Colors communicate emotion

Choosing the right color for the design is an effective UX strategy. Because colors help designers influence how users think and behave. It is the primary medium through which designs communicate with the users and build a long-lasting impression.
> For instance, McDonaldâ€™s uses the colors red and yellow in its logo to evoke stimulation and happiness.
