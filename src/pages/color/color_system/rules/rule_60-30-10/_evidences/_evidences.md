One common rule that UX designers use is the 60-30-10 rule.

- **One neutral color** makes up 60 percent of the color palette in your design.
- **A second complementary color** makes up 30 percent of the palette.
- **A third accent color** makes up 10 percent of the palette to add emphasis.

### definition-2

The 60-30-10 rule is an interior design rule you can apply to UI design. This simple guideline breaks down into the following formula to ensure interfaces remain balanced and cohesive:

- **Dominant or primary color (60%)**: This is the most prominent color within your interface and is typically associated with your brand identity. It helps set the tone and creates a solid foundation for your design.
- **Secondary colors (30%)**: This shade complements the primary color and provides a visually pleasing contrast.
- **Accent color (10%)**: These colors add pops of interest and help UI elements stand out.

Once you’ve landed on a primary color, experiment with different color palettes until you find the one you like. If your goal is to create a bold, high-contrast design, test out a complementary color palette.

A monochromatic or analogous color scheme might be ideal if you want to create a serene atmosphere.

- **Primary/main is used for 60% of the design**. This neutral color gives room for the secondary and accent colors to stand out.
- **The secondary is used for 30% of the design**. This is a middle ground that compliments the primary and accent colors. When designing for a brand, this color tends to be the secondary color for the brand.
- **The accent is used for 10% of the design**. This helps ‘accessorize’ the site by giving pops of colors that keep the viewer’s attention.

### definition-4

<https://www.andrewpetzer.co.za/design/the-power-of-the-60-30-10-colour-rule-for-web-design/>

- **60% of a dominant colour**: Your dominant colour, which covers 60% of your design, serves as the primary backdrop. It’s the canvas upon which you build your visual masterpiece. This colour creates a sense of unity and provides a strong foundation for your design.
- **30% of a secondary colour**: The secondary colour, making up 30% of your design, complements the dominant colour. It adds depth and visual interest to your composition. This colour should be different enough from the dominant one to create contrast while remaining harmonious.
- **10% of an accent colour**: The accent colour, occupying the remaining 10%, brings vibrancy and excitement to your design. This is where you can be creative and daring, adding splashes of colour that draw the viewer’s attention to key elements.

### definition-5

<https://uxplanet.org/the-60-30-10-rule-a-foolproof-way-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-d15625e56d25>

The 60–30–10 rule is a popular color theory used by interior designers, fashion designers, and graphic designers to create a balanced and harmonious color scheme. The rule states that a color scheme should consist of three colors in the following proportions:

- **60% of the dominant color**: The dominant color is the main color of the design, and it should be the most prominent and visible color.
- **30% of the secondary color**: The secondary color is a complementary color that supports the dominant color and provides visual interest.
- **10% of the accent color**: The accent color is a pop of color that adds a bit of excitement and contrast to the design.

### definition-6

<https://mmicreative.com/the-60-30-10-rule/>

The basics of the 60-30-10 Rule is to choose

- Begin with a 3-color scheme commonly used for your brand. If you have a “signature color” – think Tiffany’s blue, Coca-Cola red, Home Depot orange – use it as one of the three colors.
- If you need to add a fourth or fifth color, split either the primary or secondary colors and add a lighter or darker shade of that color to the mix. Just remember to still keep that color split within its designated percentage.
  > For example, if you split your primary color to add a lighter hue, the 60% would change to something like 40% original color plus 20% lighter hue. Resist splitting your accent color as this will dilute the punch you need this color to convey.

- **a primary color that dominates 60% of the area**: Use your primary color (60%) for backgrounds, color blocking and large text areas.
- **a secondary color to compromise about 30% of the visual field**: Use your secondary color (30%) for headlines, sidebars, highlighting or text callouts.
- and **an accent color that provides a 10% color pop**: Then use your accent color (10%), typically your boldest color, to guide the reader to take a particular action. Use it for areas you want to draw the eye to such as call-to-action areas, buttons and links.

### definition-7

<https://wpmayor.com/the-60-30-10-rule-made-our-website-designs-infinitely-better/>

Choose the Color Palette and Apply Proportions

- **The 60%**: Begin by selecting a dominant accent color that represents your brand. This will be used for large areas like backgrounds, so it’s typically white, black, or variations of either of them.

- **The 30%** The secondary color should complement the dominant color without standing out. It could be used in areas such as headers and sidebars.

- **The 10%** Finally, the accent color is the color that draws the visitors’ eye to where we want it on the page. Think of call-to-action elements or important text.

Keep website accessibility in mind when making these decisions. Make sure that the colors you choose have enough contrast for readability.

You can use color theory and tools like Coolors or Adobe Color to help guide your choices.

### definition-8

<https://anshravisuals.medium.com/understanding-the-60-30-10-rule-in-design-a-guide-to-balanced-aesthetics-6988430b24c7>

The 60–30–10 rule is one of the most fundamental principles in design, widely used across various disciplines such as interior design, graphic design, and even fashion. This timeless technique helps designers achieve a harmonious balance of colors, allowing the final product to be visually appealing and well-structured. Whether you’re creating a brand identity, website, or even a social media post, applying this rule can drastically enhance the impact of your design.

The 60–30–10 rule is a formula for balancing colors in design. It works by dividing the color palette into three distinct proportions:

- **60% Dominant Color**: This is the primary color that sets the overall tone of the design. It acts as the background color and makes up most of the space, providing the canvas on which the other colors can stand out.
- **30% Secondary Color**: The secondary color supports the dominant color and provides contrast. It should complement the primary color, allowing the design to feel cohesive and unified.
- **10% Accent Color**: This is the color used sparingly to draw attention to specific elements in the design. It creates visual interest and highlights key areas, such as buttons, icons, or headlines.

### definition-9

<https://www.davidhodder.com/the-60-30-10-colour-rule-a-guide-to-creating-harmonious-designs/>

The three colours are:

- **Dominant colour (60%)**: The dominant colour should be the main colour used in the design and cover 60% of the space.
  - This colour should represent the main message or mood that you want to convey. Consider using a colour that is closely associated with your brand.
- **Secondary colour (30%)**: The secondary colour should be a complementing colour that covers 30% of the space.
  - This colour should be used to create contrast and provide visual interest. It could be a darker or lighter shade of your dominant colour or a colour that is opposite on the colour wheel.
- **Accent colour (10%)**: The accent colour should be a contrasting colour that is used sparingly to add interest and draw attention to specific elements.
  - This colour should be used sparingly to draw attention to specific elements, such as call-to-action buttons or links.
  - It could be a bright or bold colour that stands out from the rest of the design.

### definition-10

<https://www.paigebrunton.com/blog/60-30-10-color-rule-for-web-designers>

- Some shade of white is definitely the safest choice for your 60% color when you are first getting started in design. That, or something extremely neutral.
  - Then, as you get more confident with designing, you can begin playing around with using bolder shades for your primary 60% color like you saw in [example #2](../samples/examples.md/#website-design-example-2) above!

- Now for the 30% color! Let's say you have like two primary brand colors… You want the 30% to be the one that's a little bit less eye-catching

- We’d want to save the blue for our 10% color, or the accent color we will use to draw the eye where we want it on the page, usually to wherever our calls-to-action live (like buttons or important bits of text!)

### definition-11

<https://anubhxv.medium.com/unveiling-the-60-30-10-rule-in-ux-ui-design-5b7c16fa6e3f>

- **Dominant Color: Setting the Tone**
  - Embarking on the design journey, the dominant color takes center stage, playing a pivotal role in establishing the interface’s tone and mood.
  - Carefully chosen based on factors like brand identity, target audience, and desired emotional response,
  - the dominant color saturates significant elements such as backgrounds, headers, or expansive sections, laying the foundation for a cohesive and visually structured design.
  > For instance, if the brand seeks to convey trust and calmness, a soothing blue might be the perfect dominant color choice. This sets the initial tone, inviting users into an environment that resonates with the brand’s essence.

- **Secondary Color: Adding Variety and Harmony**
  - As the design canvas unfolds, the secondary color steps in to complement the dominant hue, injecting variety while maintaining an essential sense of harmony. Applied to smaller sections or elements, this color strategically highlights key features, call-to-action buttons, or other crucial components within the interface.
  > Imagine a travel app where the dominant color is a serene green representing nature. A secondary color like a lively yellow could be employed to highlight essential buttons, guiding users to take actions like booking a trip or exploring exciting destinations.

- **Accent Colors: Guiding Users with Pops of Detail**
  - In the final strokes of the color palette, accent colors take their place, occupying a mere 10%. These vibrant pops of detail are sparingly used for elements that demand attention — buttons, icons, hyperlinks, or any interactive components. They create a visual hierarchy that guides users through the interface, adding interest and facilitating seamless navigation.
  > In the context of a social media app, accent colors might be strategically placed on notification icons, encouraging users to engage with updates and messages. This subtle use of color draws attention without overwhelming the overall visual experience.

### definition-12

<https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/60-30-10-rule/#color-harmony-in-brand-identities-and-design-aesthetics>

This rule, simple yet profound, divides color usage into three distinct categories:

- **60 percent for the dominant color**: This color sets the overall tone of your design. It should be a neutral or low-saturated color that doesn’t overpower the rest of the design. This color typically covers large areas like the background.

- **30 percent for the secondary color**: This color should complement the dominant color. It’s used in smaller areas, like sidebars or secondary sections, to create contrast and interest.
  - These secondary colors should be chosen to contrast and complement the universal palette while adding a unique touch that represents the brand. It’s also important to consider the emotional and psychological associations of these colors to ensure they resonate with the brand’s values and message.

- **10 percent for the accent color**: This color should be the most vibrant, and used sparingly for call-to-action buttons or key elements you want to highlight.
  - This small portion includes unique brand colors or quirky design elements that are distinctive to each identity

*Remember, the 60-30-10 rule is a guideline, not a hard rule. Feel free to adjust the percentages slightly to suit your design*.

### definition-13

<https://blog.prototypr.io/tips-for-creating-a-better-color-palette-c69d9c20ae37>

This technique comes from real-world design, but it perfectly fits for digital products. The 60% + 30% + 10% rule works because it brings the feel of balance and helps the eye move smoothly from one CTA area to another, guiding your user through the interface.

The rule is super simple and goes like this:

- 60% of your space is for your primary/area color;
- 30% Is your secondary/supportive color;
- 10% Is your accent and guiding color.

You can use these proportions to find the right balance when matching and combining your colors without turning your UI into a colorful mash.

- The primary color is the first thing you should decide on.
- The primary color is displayed most frequently across your screens
- is used to point users to UI’s focal actions.
- Ideally, you should have 1 to 3 primary colors easily associated with your brand or product. That’s it.

### definition-14

<https://supercharge.design/articles/what-is-the-3-color-rule-in-ui-design>

The secondary color is usually a less dominant shade that still aligns with the overall design and brand palette.

### Steps evidence-1

<https://uxplanet.org/the-60-30-10-rule-a-foolproof-way-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-d15625e56d25>

**Primary color:**

The dominant color is the foundation of your color scheme. It sets the tone and mood of your design and should be the most prevalent color. To choose your dominant color, consider the following factors:

- **Your brand’s colors**: If you’re designing a UI for a brand, you’ll want to use the brand’s colors as your dominant color. This will ensure consistency and reinforce brand recognition.
- **Your audience**: Consider your target audience and the emotions you want to evoke.
  > For example, if you’re designing a health app, you may want to use calming and soothing colors such as blue and green.
- **Your design goals**: Think about the purpose of your UI design and the message you want to convey.
  > For example, if you’re designing a travel app, you may want to use vibrant and adventurous colors such as orange and yellow.

Once you’ve chosen your dominant color, make sure it’s present in the most prominent areas of your design, such as the background, header, or main button.

**Secondary color:**

The secondary color should complement your dominant color and provide visual interest. To choose your secondary color, consider the following factors:

- **Color theory**: Look at the color wheel and choose a color that complements your dominant color.
  > For example, if your dominant color is blue, you may want to use a complementary color such as orange or yellow.
- **Contrast**: Choose a color that provides enough contrast with your dominant color. This will make your design more legible and accessible.
  > For example, if your dominant color is dark, you may want to use a lighter secondary color.
- **Mood**: Consider the emotions you want to evoke and choose a color that supports your design goals.
  > For example, if you’re designing a fitness app, you may want to use a vibrant and energetic color such as red or orange.

Once you’ve chosen your secondary color, use it to highlight important elements of your design, such as headings, subheadings, or call-to-action buttons.

**Accent color:**

The accent color is a pop of color that adds a bit of excitement and contrast to your design. To choose your accent color, consider the following factors:

- **Color theory**: Look at the color wheel and choose a color that contrasts with your dominant and secondary colors.
  > For example, if your dominant color is blue and your secondary color is green, you may want to use an accent color such as pink or yellow.
- **Contrast**: Choose an accent color that provides enough contrast with your dominant and secondary colors. This will make your design more visually interesting and dynamic.
- **Mood**: Consider the emotions you want to evoke and choose an accent color that supports your design goals. For example, if you’re designing a food app, you may want to use a warm and inviting color such as red or orange.
- Color psychology can help you choose colors more effectively (2)

Once you’ve chosen your accent color, use it sparingly to draw attention to specific elements of your design, such as icons, badges, or links.

**Primary color:**

This is the dominant color or the primary color. It’s the one that stands out most. When choosing this shade it’s important to know what its meaning is. It should reflect the message of your brand.

Color psychology can help you choose colors more effectively — a resource that might be useful in learning about color psychology is:

**Secondary color:**

<https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/60-30-10-rule-how-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-713b3d4c1445>

After choosing your primary color you can use a color resource to generate the next two colors. Resources for generating colors are plenty, but the ones I use are:

- <https://mycolor.space/>
- <https://paletton.com/>
- <https://coolors.co/>

This is the secondary color or complementary color. You’ll use half as much of this color as you did your main hue. This is used on major elements such as text, carousels, and other important features

The secondary color supports the main one but is still different enough to create contrast.

**Accent color:**

<https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/60-30-10-rule-how-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-713b3d4c1445>

This is the accent color. This color can be used in buttons, pop-ups, highlights, etc.

Bright, vibrant colors are a great way to add visual interest. They can help draw attention to specific areas of a page or make it feel more alive overall.

After choosing a dominant color, I then balanced it with two other colors to produce the final design shown below

Now that you have a grasp of the concept, let’s explore how to apply the 60-30-10 Colour Rule effectively in web design.

- Start by selecting your dominant colour based on your brand identity and the emotions you want to evoke.
- Then, choose a complementary secondary colour to create contrast and variety.
- Finally, add an accent colour to emphasise key elements on your site, such as buttons or headings.

Remember that consistency is key. Ensure that your chosen colours are used consistently throughout your website to maintain a cohesive and polished look. Avoid the temptation to use too many colours, as this can lead to a chaotic and confusing design.

### Steps evidence-4

**Color harmony in brand identities and design aesthetics.**

Maintaining color harmony while accommodating different brand identities and design languages requires a thoughtful and flexible approach. The 60-30-10 rule can serve as a great guideline for achieving visual balance and consistency across brand identities and design styles. Here’s a quick rundown of how to apply this rule effectively:

- **Define a universal color palette (60%)**: Start by deciding on a universal color palette that forms the foundation of your design system. This palette should ideally consist of neutral and versatile colors that can harmonize with different brand identities and design aesthetics.
  - The 60 percent portion of your design can integrate these universal colors as their primary background or base.

- **Adapt secondary colors (30%)**: The 30 percent portion of your design should be used to incorporate secondary colors that align with the particular brand identity you’re working with.
- **Brand-specific accents (10%)**: The final 10 percent is dedicated to brand-specific accents or highlights.

Create brand design guidelines

Documenting your design decisions and creating detailed design guidelines or a style guide that outlines how the 60-30-10 rule should be applied across all the assets is a very important part of making your design process streamlined and consistent.

This guide should include details on color usage, typography, and layout to ensure consistency in future designs for the brand.

### Steps evidence-5

<https://anshravisuals.medium.com/understanding-the-60-30-10-rule-in-design-a-guide-to-balanced-aesthetics-6988430b24c7>

How to Apply the 60–30–10 Rule

1. **Choose Your Dominant Color (60%)**: Start by selecting a base color that will make up 60% of your design. This color should align with the tone and mood you want to convey.
    > For example, a soft blue can evoke a calm and serene atmosphere, while a bold red can create a sense of urgency and excitement.

2. **Pick a Complementary Secondary Color (30**%): The secondary color should complement the dominant color without overwhelming it. Look for a hue that contrasts enough to create visual interest but still blends harmoniously with the base color. In many cases, designers choose a color from the same family or a contrasting shade on the color wheel.

3. **Add Your Accent Color (10%)**: The accent color is where you can get creative. This small portion of your design should stand out, bringing attention to key elements like buttons, icons, or important text. Since this color is used sparingly, you can afford to choose a bolder hue, even one that’s starkly different from your primary and secondary colors.

### Steps evidence-6

<https://www.davidhodder.com/the-60-30-10-colour-rule-a-guide-to-creating-harmonious-designs/>

How to apply the 60-30-10 colour rule to your designs

- **Choose your dominant colour**: Start by selecting a dominant colour that will be the primary colour of your design.
- **Pick your secondary colour**: Next, choose a secondary colour that complements your dominant colour.
- **Add your accent colour**: Finally, choose an accent colour that contrasts with your dominant and secondary colours.

Test your colour scheme

Once you have selected your colours, test your colour scheme to ensure that it looks visually appealing and balanced.

Consider using colour palette generators or tools like Adobe Colour to help you choose complementary colours.

### Steps evidence-7

<https://mmicreative.com/the-60-30-10-rule/>

The 60-30-10 Rule helps to visually organize color, keeping your design be it print or web, from getting cluttered and confusing with too much color usage.

- Begin with a 3-color scheme commonly used for your brand. If you have a “signature color” – think Tiffany’s blue, Coca-Cola red, Home Depot orange – use it as one of the three colors.
- Then decide the percentage usage (primary, secondary and accent) for each of the three colors.
- If you need to add a fourth or fifth color, split either the primary or secondary colors and add a lighter or darker shade of that color to the mix. Just remember to still keep that color split within its designated percentage.
  > For example, if you split your primary color to add a lighter hue, the 60% would change to something like 40% original color plus 20% lighter hue. Resist splitting your accent color as this will dilute the punch you need this color to convey.

Beyond a mere distribution of colors, implementing the 60–30–10 rule involves a delicate dance between design principles and a deep understanding of color psychology, branding, user behavior, and accessibility.

- **Color Psychology: Eliciting Emotions**: Colors are not arbitrary; they carry psychological weight, influencing user emotions and behavior. As a designer, I delve into the emotional impact of each color, aligning the dominant color with the brand’s personality.
  > Blue, for instance, may evoke trust and calmness, while red can instill excitement or urgency.

- **Branding: A Consistent Visual Identity**: The color palette chosen should align seamlessly with the brand’s identity. Consistency across digital and offline touchpoints enhances brand recognition, with the dominant color becoming synonymous with the brand itself. This consistency creates a memorable and cohesive user experience.
  > Drawing inspiration from Kolkata’s rich cultural tapestry, I’ve learned to infuse local nuances into my designs, creating interfaces that resonate with the city’s vibrancy and diversity.

- **User Behavior: Navigating the Visual Hierarchy**: Understanding how users perceive and interact with elements is crucial. The 60–30–10 rule intuitively acknowledges the natural hierarchy, with the dominant color capturing initial attention, the secondary color guiding users, and accent colors pinpointing interactive elements. This intentional distribution enhances usability and user satisfaction.

- **Accessibility: Designing for All**: In the dynamic landscape of UX design, aesthetics must coexist with accessibility. Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors is imperative for users with visual impairments. The 60–30–10 rule adapts gracefully, allowing designers to prioritize accessibility without compromising the overall design.

- **The Practical Journey: Prototyping, Testing, and Adapting**: Implementing the 60–30–10 rule in real-world design involves iterative processes. Prototyping allows for a tangible exploration of color distribution, while user testing and feedback become invaluable tools for assessing how well the color scheme aligns with user expectations and preferences.
  > As a UX designer, I’ve honed my skills in navigating design iterations, welcoming user feedback as a compass guiding the evolution of the color palette. This iterative approach ensures that the final design not only adheres to the 60–30–10 rule but also resonates with users on a practical level.

- **Flexibility in Design: Adapting to Project Dynamics**: While the 60–30–10 rule provides a solid foundation, it’s not a rigid formula. Each project comes with unique requirements, brand characteristics, and design objectives. Flexibility is a designer’s ally, allowing for adaptation of the color distribution to suit the project’s specific needs while preserving the underlying principles of balance and harmony.
  > Reflecting on my experiences in Kolkata’s dynamic design community, I’ve witnessed how flexibility in design thinking fosters innovation and meets the diverse needs of clients and users alike.

Now that you know how to apply the 60–30–10 rule to your UI design, let’s look at some tips to help you use it effectively:

- **Experiment with different color combinations**: The 60–30–10 rule is a guideline, not a strict rule. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different color combinations and adjust the proportions to suit your design goals.
- **Use shades and tints**: To add depth and complexity to your color scheme, use shades and tints of your dominant and secondary colors. This will create a cohesive and harmonious design.
- **Use color palettes**: Use online tools such as Coolors or Adobe Color to create color palettes based on the 60–30–10 rule. This will save you time and help you choose colors that work well together.
- **Test your design**: Once you’ve chosen your colors, test your design on different devices and in different lighting conditions. This will ensure that your design is legible and accessible to all users.
