# Color Harmony/Scheme

**A color scheme is a set of colors that work well together visually**. [3]

**In color theory, a color scheme is a combination of 2 or more colors used in aesthetic or practical design. Aesthetic color schemes are used to create style and appeal**. [4]

*Color Schemes aka Color Harmony*. [5]

## Monochromatic

The monochromatic scheme involves taking one hue and creating other design elements from shades and tints.

![alt text](idf_monochromatic.png)

**This formula uses a single hue further allowing you to explore different saturation and value to create variations of that color**.[1],[2]

![alt text](scheme_monochromatic.png)

**Effects:**

- This formula is guaranteed to match, creating a visually cohesive look. [1]
- It’s also considered the easiest on the eyes. [1]
- It doesn’t draw attention to itself and can help associate brands with a specific, memorable color. [1]
- A monochromatic color palette can be seen as undeniably chic and conservative. [1]
- It may also fall prey to boredom, depending on the use. [1]
- Monochromatic schemes are easy to create, but can also be boring when done poorly. [2]

**Usages:**

- These are the simplest color schemes to create, as they’re all taken from the same hue, making it harder to create a jarring or ugly scheme (though both are still possible). [2]
- You can bend the rules a little bit – and still keep the monochromatic scheme – by using a complementary, or accent color. The complementary hue can be found directly across from your chosen color and, used sparingly, do the trick. [1]
- Monochromatic schemes are easy to create, but can also be boring when done poorly. Adding in a strong neutral like white or black can help keep things interesting. [2]

**Examples:**

Here are three examples of monochrome color schemes. For the most part with these schemes, the first color (if we look at this from left to right) would likely be used for headlines. The second color would be used for body text or possibly the background. The third color would likely be used for the background (or body text if color #2 was used as the background). And the last two colors would be used as accents or within graphics. [2]

## Analogous

Analogous colors involve using three colors next to each other on the color wheel, such as blue, blue-violet, and violet.

![alt text](idf_analogous.png)

The analogous combination uses colors that are next to each other on the color wheel like blues and greens or reds and oranges.[1]

Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel. [2]

![alt text](scheme_analogous.png)

**Effects:**

- They match extremely well and create schemes that are pleasing to the eye.[1]
  > You will often find this very versatile combination in nature – picture red, orange and yellow leaves in the Autumn or the sky during sunset.
- An analogous scheme is great for very serene, peaceful designs where you want your audience to feel comfortable and relaxed.[1]
- It doesn’t mean that you can’t use the same color scheme to create other feelings like exuberance and energy, especially if using warm hues.[1]

**Usages:**

- Analogous color schemes are the next easiest to create. [2]
- Traditionally, analogous color schemes all have the same chroma level, but by using tones, shades, and tints we can add interest to these schemes and adapt them to our needs for designing websites. [2]

**Examples:**

- This is a traditional analogous color scheme, and while it's visually appealing, there isn't enough contrast between the colors for an effective website design. [2]

![alt text](./examples/analogous_1.png)

- Here's a color scheme with the same hues as the one above, but with the chroma adjusted to give more variety. It's now much more suitable for use in a website. [2]

![alt text](./examples/analogous_2.png)

- Another example of a traditional analogous scheme. [2]

![alt text](./examples/analogous_3.png)

- And the above theme modified for use in a website design. [2]

![alt text](./examples/analogous_4.png)

## Complementary

Designers use 'opposite color' pairs like blue and yellow to maximize contrast here.

![alt text](idf_complementary.png)

Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel, like red & green or blue & orange. [1][2]

![alt text](scheme_complementary.png)

**Effects:**

- This combination, when they have the same value (tint/shade), is extremely vibrant and dynamic, and this is why they are constantly used in sports.
- Its high-contrast and high-intensity create *"visually jarring"* or *“vibrating boundaries”* when color vibration happens along the edges separating hues of the same value.

**Usages:**

- This scheme can be difficult to apply in a harmonious way if used in its purest form. The solution here is to introduce tint, shade, or desaturated tones to one of the colors or add a neutral color to the mix. It’ll add some variety and eliminate the *vibrating boundaries* while keeping the contrast. [1],[2]
- (*vibrating boundaries*) This is best avoided (either by leaving negative space or by adding another, transitional color between them). [2]

**Examples:**

- A wide range of tints, shades, and tones makes this a very versatile color scheme. [2]

![alt text](./examples/complementary_1.png)

- Another complementary color scheme with a wide range of chromas. Notice how placing the brighter red and green colors next to each other, a sort of “vibrating” quality is achieved on their edges. Be aware of this in your designs and make sure it’s done intentionally, if it all. [2]

![alt text](./examples/complementary_2.png)

- Don't forget that beige and brown are just tints and shades of orange. [2]

![alt text](./examples/complementary_3.png)

## Split-Complementary or Compound Harmony

Split complementary schemes add more complexity than regular complementary schemes. In this scheme, instead of using colors that are opposites, you use colors on either side of the hue opposite your base hue. [1],[2]

![alt text](idf_split-complementary.png)

![alt text](scheme_split-complementary.png)

**Effects:**

- It still gives you contrast, like in the complementary scheme, but adds more colors to work with and more interesting results.[1]
- This scheme uses colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften the contrast. [3]

**Usages:**

**Examples:**

- A scheme where yellow-green is the base hue. It's important to have enough difference in chroma and value between the colors you select for this type of scheme. [2]

![alt text](./examples/split_complementary_1.png)

- Another palette with a wide range of chromas. [2]

![alt text](./examples/split_complementary_2.png)

## Triadic

The Triadic scheme uses three equally distant colors on the color wheel. It maintains harmony and high contrast. [3]

![alt text](idf_triadic.png)

**The triadic scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced, forming a perfect triangle on the color wheel**. [1],[2]

![alt text](scheme_triadic.png)

**Effects:**

- This is one of the more diverse color schemes. They can be difficult to do well, but add a lot of visual interest to a design when they are. [2]
- These combinations tend to be striking and stimulating, especially if you use primary or secondary colors. [1]

**Usages:**

- Play around with tints & shades to create a scheme with less contrast. [1]
- Use one as the main color and the other two as accents. [1]
- The hardest part of this formula is getting the three colors to match the descriptions of your brand personality. I suggest you get to the questions list and color symbolism chart first before you decide to use this scheme. [1]

**Examples:**

- Using a very pale or dark version of one color in the triad, along with two shades/tones/tints of the other two colors makes the single color almost work as a neutral within the scheme. [2]

![alt text](./examples/triadic_1.png)

- Alternately, using one very bright hue with paired muted hues makes the single bright hue stand out more. [2]

![alt text](./examples/triadic_2.png)

## Tetradic or Double-Complementary

This involves using four colors that form two sets of complementary pairs with one color dominating.

![alt text](idf_tetradic.png)

**This scheme forms a rectangle on the wheel, using two complementary color pairs**.

**Effects:**

- It’s a very eye-catching combination, but may be harder to apply in your designs, since more colors are more difficult to balance.

**Usages:**

- Tetradic color schemes are probably the most difficult schemes to pull off effectively. [2]
- This combination works better if you choose one color to be the main hue, while the others can serve as accent colors, with adjusted saturation and value of some or all colors.
- *PRO TIP*: If you’re not confident with your color-choosing abilities, I suggest you stay away from this color harmony formula.

**Examples:**

- A rather unimpressive tetradic color scheme. The best way to use a scheme like this is to use one color as the primary color in a design and the others just as accents. [2]

![alt text](./examples/tetradic_1.png)

- Tetradic color schemes can work well for creating color schemes with similar chromas and values. Just add a neutral (such as dark gray or black) for text and accents. [2]

![alt text](./examples/tetradic_2.png)

- It works just as well for darker color schemes. [2]

![alt text](./examples/tetradic_3.png)

## Square

A variant of tetradic, this scheme finds four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel.

![alt text](idf_square.png)

## Diad

**a scheme with 2 colors separated by one color on the color wheel**.

![alt text](diad_color_scheme.png)

- Pros: cohesive
- Cons: lacks extreme contrast

*Tips: avoid combining warm and cool colors, don’t have too many colors*.
*The color properties and color schemes can be combined in picking the best possible color scheme for your designs*.

## Accented Neutral

Custom color schemes are the hardest to create. Instead of following the predefined color schemes discussed above, a custom scheme isn’t based on any formal rules. Keep in mind things like chroma, value, and saturation when creating these kinds of color schemes. [2]

**Examples:**

- The colors here all have similar chroma and saturation levels. [2]

![alt text](./examples/custom_1.png)

- Again, using colors with similar chroma and saturation is effective and creates a sense of cohesion across a color scheme. [2]

![alt text](./examples/custom_2.png)

- Using one color with a high chroma among other colors with lower chromas is another effective method (the higher chroma color would/can act as an accent). [2]

(Neutral Primary color + Accent color)

Harmony của neutral color với hue color như thế nào?

Là một loại harmony khác các harmony nằm trên color wheel, được gọi là aesthetic color harmony

—————————-

What is color scheme with black or any neutral colors and main color, such as red or orange?


A color scheme that includes black or other neutral colors (like gray, white, or beige) alongside a main color (such as red or orange) is often referred to as a neutral + accent scheme. Some common types include:

1. Monochromatic Neutral + Accent “ Uses black, white, and grays with a single bold accent (e.g., red or orange).
2. Minimalist Modern “ Primarily black, white, and shades of gray, with a pop of color for emphasis.
3. Dark Mode + Vibrant Accent “ Often seen in UI/UX design, where a dark background is contrasted with a bright color like red, orange, or blue.
4. Industrial or Urban “ Uses dark grays, blacks, and neutral textures (like concrete or wood) with a bold accent color.
5. High-Contrast Bold “ Black and white as a base with a striking red or orange to create energy and drama.


There is a single universal name for these schemes, but some commonly used terms describe them:

1. Neutral + Accent“ A general term for color palettes with neutrals and a strong accent color.
2. Dark & Vibrant“ Often used in UI/UX and branding for a sleek, modern look.
3. High Contrast“ When black and white are paired with a bold accent like red or orange.
4. Industrial Chic“ Often seen in interior design, using dark neutrals with a strong color pop.
5. Neo-Noir“ A dramatic black-heavy scheme with a striking color (often red).
6. Fire & Shadow“ When warm colors like red or orange contrast with black or gray.
7. Sporty Dynamic“ Common in athletic branding, using black or gray with red, orange, or yellow for energy.

If you have a specific industry or mood in mind, I can help refine the terminology!

Uhm, which means they have custom names, instead of traditional names, such as complementary or tetradic, right?

Yes, exactly! Unlike traditional color harmonies like complementary, analogous, triadic, or tetradic, which follow strict color wheel relationships, neutral + accent schemes are more stylistic and can be named based on their aesthetic, mood, or industry use.

These schemes do have a fixed rule like red and green are complementary. Instead, they rely on the contrast between a neutral base (black, gray, white, or beige) and a bold color (red, orange, etc.), which makes them more flexible for branding, UI/UX, and modern design.

Would you like help choosing a specific name for your project™s color scheme?

Yup, my main color is darked coffee brown, accent color is red, and neutral color is beige

That™s a rich and warm color scheme! Here are a few name ideas based on its aesthetic:

1. Roast & Ember“ Evokes the warmth of coffee and the glow of red embers.
2. Mocha Flame“ A mix of deep coffee tones with fiery red.
3. Velvet Espresso“ A luxurious take, with deep brown and bold red.
4. CafÃ© Noir“ Sophisticated and moody, perfect for a high-end coffee brand.
5. Spiced Latte“ Reflecting the warmth of coffee with a spicy red pop.

An accented neutral color scheme is a design strategy that uses neutral colors with a small amount of additional colors.
What are neutral colors?
Neutral colors are muted colors that lack brightness.
They can be light, medium, or dark.
Examples of neutral colors include white, beige, brown, gray, and black.

**What are accent colors?**

- Accent colors are brighter colors that are added to neutral colors.
  > Examples of accent colors include blue, red, and pink.
- Where can accented neutral color schemes be used?
  - Interior design: Accented neutral color schemes can be used in interior design to create a creative and versatile space.
  - UI design: Accented neutral colors can be used in UI design for text color and whitespace.
  - Cakes: Accented neutral colors can be used to decorate cakes.

**How can you create an accented neutral color scheme?**:

- You can add a pop of color to a neutral color scheme.
- You can add color to existing furniture by painting or reupholstering it.
- You can add color to your space with artwork, throw pillows, or patterned wallpaper.
