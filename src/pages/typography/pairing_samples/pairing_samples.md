# Pairing/Combination Samples/cheat sheet

To make it easier for you to use this guide as a reference material, we’ve arranged our 30 unique font combinations according to the content or publication type they work best for. [1]

## Design publication font combination: League Spartan + Libre Baskerville [1]

![01fontpairingdesignpub](01fontpairingdesignpub.jpg)

- **League Spartan** is a modern typeface with strong structure and geometric form. This contrasts well against the elegant and more traditional style of **Libre Baskerville**. Using a serif for your body copy makes dense information easy to read.
- Columns are a great way to contain your text. Shorter lines of text are easier to read, so when you have limited copy, try to reduce the width of your text space.

## Resumé font combination: Julius Sans One + Archivo Narrow [1]

![02fontpairingresume](02fontpairingresume.jpg)

- **Julius Sans One** offers a fine stroke, and its broader baseline makes it a great display font. Offsetting well against the more masculine and geometric style of **Archivo Narrow**, these typefaces offer a good font combination for easy readability.
- Resumes [3] and formal documents are often lacklustre when it comes to font and font combinations, but they don’t have to be. Combining clean, easy-to-read typefaces that create hierarchy and balance is imperative when you are trying to convey a message.

## Sports/active: Archivo Black font [1]

![03fontpairingsports](03fontpairingsports.jpg)

- A bold, rounded typeface combined with a lighter, condensed style will make for happy font combination. All three fonts in this example are strong and easy-to-read. The bold, wide Archivo Black creates impact, appropriate for an activity-oriented audience.

Here the text color has been broken up to complement the composition and colors in the background image. Communicating with visual techniques like this brings more symbolism to your designs.

- Don’t be afraid to use one typeface across your entire brand. Finding fonts like Libre Baskerville that have style variants is a clever way to create nuance without overcomplicating your designs. This typeface is a classic serif that is beautifully applied as a heading and easy-to-read body copy.

To elaborate on how easy it is to use different font variants, here is an example of Libre Baskerville in action. Using an italic pronounces a word or subheading without having to change font-families.

## Fashion retail font combination: Bebas Neue + Montserrat [1]

![05-font-pairing-fashion-retail](05fontpairingfashionretail.jpg)

- Bebas Neue is a favorite in the design-sphere. Its condensed and clean form makes it excellent to use for headings. Round and narrow typefaces offset nicely against each other. The contrast between Bebas and Montserrat makes for a tidy and contemporary font combination.

## Front page font combination: Open Sans Extra Bold + Cooper Hewitt+ PT Sans [1]

![07fontpairingfrontpage](07fontpairingfrontpage.jpg)

- This font combination has similarities to combinations you would find in newspapers or publishing. **Open Sans Extra Bold** grabs the attention of your audience, much like that of a headline. These typefaces are tough and straight to the point.
- The light **Cooper Hewitt** applied in uppercase is a great contrasting subhead or chapter marker, as is the easy-to-read **PT Sans** for body copy. These typefaces are well balanced and create a solid, well-anchored style.

![alt text](7FrontPagetb800x0.jpg)

## Technology: Roboto Condensed font [1]

![alt text](08fontpairingtechnology.jpg)

- **Roboto Condensed** is a sans serif typeface with a sans serif reading rhythm, which makes it a great choice for body copy. When applied in bold, the font works very well for a heading. The extended x-height of the typeface enhances the already well-condensed effect of the font.

Headings and subtitles don’t have to sit in order, which is why we use scale and size to differentiate them. Create some nuance by using clever spacing between your ascenders and descenders to place some text.

![alt text](8Technologytb800x0.jpg)

## Art gallery: Cooper Hewitt font [1]

![alt text](09fontpairingartgallery.jpg)

- With strong arches and curves, Cooper Hewitt is a classic typeface with excellent variations to use to separate your headings, subheadings and body copy respectively.

![alt text](9ArtGallerytb800x0.jpg)

![alt text](exhibition.jpg)

## Invitation and events: Playfair Display font [1]

![alt text](10fontpairingInvitationandevents.jpg)

- **Playfair Display** is an excellent typeface to use for wedding or invitation design. The heavy style of **Playfair Display Black** offsets beautifully against **Playfair Display Italic**, creating a harmonious hierarchy.

![alt text](10QuoteGraphicstb800x0.jpg)

## Industrial font combination: Norwester + Kollektif + Montserrat [1]

![alt text](12fontpairingindustrialcool.jpg)

- **Norwester** is an attention-grabbing, geometric font best used for headings. The font combination of **Norwester**, **Kollektif** and **Montserrat** is structured and geometric.

![alt text](11IndustrialCooltb800x0.jpg)

## Lifestyle magazine font combination: Source Sans Pro + Source Serif Pro [1]

![alt text](12fontpairinglifestyle.jpg)

- **Source Sans Pro** and **Source Serif Pro** were created to be used as a combination in design and are another excellent example of typographic harmony.

Using a grid is one of the easiest ways to form a clean, structured composition, which creates balance and hierarchy, and color enhances these features by pulling tones in from the images to form consistency and visual harmony.

![alt text](12LifestyleMagazinetb800x0.jpg)

## Bike shop font combination: Yellowtail + Open Sans Bold + Open Sans light [1]

![alt text](13fontpairingbikeshop.jpg)

- A fun combination: **Yellowtail** is a fat brush script typeface with a mix of connecting letterforms. It contrasts nicely against the bold and more basic style of **Open Sans Bold** and **Open Sans Light**.

Script typefaces make for lovely and embellished short headings. Too many words are hard to read, so best to keep your application of script to a limited number of words. Take advantage of the slanted form of a script typeface by adjusting the angle a little.

Note: Find the natural composition of your background to place your text, letting descenders drop into spaces and curl around objects.

![alt text](BikeShoptb800x0.jpg)

The Yellowtail font works great with any lifestyle design, just like the Blue and Pink Collage Clothes Retail Shop Facebook Post template.

## Exhibition font combination: Raleway + Roboto Condensed [1]

![alt text](14fontpairingexhibition.jpg)

- A great combination, the roundness of **Raleway** contrasts well with the condensed **Roboto Condensed**. A fine-weighted subheading offsets well against a heavier heading typeface.

Using mixed weights of one typeface is an excellent way to enhance hierarchy and form some nuance. Tying in a color from your background image will connect your audience with the subject matter.

![alt text](Exhibitiontb800x0.jpg)

## Mediterranean font combination:Cinzel + Quattrocento + Lora [1]

![alt text](15fontpairingmediterranean.jpg)

- **Cinzel** is considered contemporary, although it was inspired by the classical Roman style. With the delicate strokes of **Quattrocento** and **Lora**’s curves, this is a fine font combination to use for headings or for invitations.

This application is a more traditional and expected style. Finding words that are a similar length or width will create a nice form for the composition of your design.

![alt text](FashionPhotoSpringBreakSaleInstagramPost.jpg)

## Form and function font combination: Oswald font + Montserrat Light + Cooper Hewitt [1]

![alt text](16fontpairingformfunction.jpg)

- **Oswald** has been redesigned as a web font to work across all digital screens.
- Teamed with **Montserrat Light** and **Cooper Hewitt**, this is a highly functional and easy to read interface font combination.

To amplify a typeface like Oswald, use a contrasting color behind the sections of text. This not only makes it stand out but also enhances the hierarchy between your heading, subheading and body copy. Alignment is important, so ensure you place these blocks deliberately.To create a strong monochromatic style, use black and white elements grouped with a desaturated image.

![alt text](16FormandFunctiontb800x0.jpg)

## Annual Reports: Cooper Hewitt Thin

![alt text](17fontpairingannualreport.jpg)

Reports require less complicated type combinations, which makes this trio a great choice. Don’t be afraid to use a thin typeface as a heading. This is one of the best ways to take advantage of a very fine type weight as it shows off the structure and letterform.

When you are applying fine typefaces, it’s imperative to ensure that it’s easy to read. Applying over a flat color can help with this, forming a contrast and letting the form stand out.

Note: Lighter typefaces risk looking weak; combining them with bold colors and additional elements will give your design some gusto.

## Art and objects: Kollektif font

![alt text](18fontpairingartobjects.jpg)

Kollektif was created in a fight against the fine, clean style of the geometric typefaces of the 21st Century. The disruptor is a round and strong typeface great for both web and print material. Gidole offers a heavy contrast with a fine and condensed form.

Choosing a typeface isn’t just about whether you like it or not, it’s about how the words in your copy look when the typeface is applied. It might be the descender on the g or the k that hugs the o (like in Kollektif). The tittle on the 'i' is quite round and creates an element of nuance in contrast to the structured and otherwise angular typeface.

![alt text](18ArtandObjecttb800x0.jpg)

## Fashion magazines font combination: Bodoni + Montserrat

![alt text](19fontpairingfashionmagazine.jpg)

**Bodoni** is known as a classic magazine heading typeface. [Massimo Vignelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli) stated that ‘**Bodoni** is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed’. The application of **Bodoni** paired with the contrasting of Montserrat is sophisticated and contemporary.

Finding shapes within your background image is a clever technique to contain your text. Ensure your text color contrasts against the color behind as there may be detail in your image that would make your text hard to read.

![alt text](19FashionMagazinetb800x0.jpg)

![alt text](WomensFashionMagazine.jpg)

## Adventure: Merriweather font

![alt text](20fontpairingadventure.jpg)

**Merriweather** was created specifically for web design and not favored as a print typeface. The combination of bold and regular style variants makes for easy reading and classic aesthetic.

Rules are also made to be broken, so don’t take these sizings and font combinations too seriously. Be creative with your placement and style variants, especially for the sake of conceptual design treatments like creating hierarchy and typographic styles.

![alt text](20Adventuretb800x0.jpg)

## Zine font combination: League Gothic + Archivo Narrow + Kollektif

![alt text](21fontpairingzine.jpg)

**League Gothic** has a distinctive condensed style that has similarities to **Archivo Narrow** yet offsets well against the round form of Kollektif, acting as a nice barrier between heading and body copy.

Make interesting compositions using shapes, photos and elements. [Color is a crucial element to tying in your design elements](https://www.canva.com/learn/color-meanings-symbolism/). Here it acts as a break from the desaturated photos and brings life to the title. Aligned placement of the chunky keyline below the heading forms an anchor and separates the copy from the heading. The intro heading is the same width as the first word of the main heading (Return) for visual harmony. Remember, design is deliberate, so ensuring elements line up is an imperative part of the creative process.

![alt text](21Zinetb800x0.jpg)

## Web design: Lato font

![alt text](22fontpairingwebdesign.jpg)

A relatively new typeface, **Lato** is an excellent choice for user interface website design. Lato’s semi-rounded characters create warmth, which isn’t always apparent in web fonts. Here, the strong form provides stability and slight masculinity.

![alt text](23FinancialAdvertisingtb800x0.jpg)

## Hotel font combination: Sifonn + Bebas Neue + Montserrat light

![alt text](24fontpairinghotel.jpg)

A contemporary and art-deco inspired combination, these geometric typefaces contrast and complement. **Sifonn** is a strong display font and ideal for headings and less copy heavy sections of text. Applying a high contrast font like **Bebas Neue** for the subheading forms visual harmony.

This application has been used with a more complex photo grid. Images are placed and cropped deliberately within grids to complement the form of the photograph. Here the text has been placed on the darkest section of the photo and follows the form of the feature within the image.

In context, you can see how the fine lines complement the subject well.

Both **Source Sans Pro** and **Open Sans** are typefaces intended to work well in user interfaces. Online newsletters and reports need clean, easy-to-read combinations that clearly define heading, subheading and body copy so readers can scan and identify what they want to read.

Six Caps is a condensed and tight display font, ideal to use for a heading. Teamed with Archivo Narrow, this font combination makes for a 60s retrospective styling. The clear distinction between the three styles means the information will be communicated in order of importance.
